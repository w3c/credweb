Proposal: Make it clear who is behind each item of web content

Some Issues and Possible Answers (from MisinfoCon DC breakout)

1. Legitimately anonymous journalists/publishers
  * Answer? Pseudonyms with trusted certifier
2. Shell Company Ownership/Secret proxies
  * Use banking model of understanding money transfers (know your customer regs)
  * Have some trusted figures in organization
3. Reputation might not really help, people maybe don’t care
  * Maybe accountability does, if rep doesn’t
4. Legit publishers can be tainted by slight connections
  * Include explanatory statements, explain editorial controls, mitigate influence
5. This doesn’t turn into a 1-bit answer for platforms
  * The 1-bit is to motivate compliance, and then some people will look under the hood; like nutrition  labels
6. Pop-up / hit-and-run sites
  * Waiting period
7. Do bloggers and knitting magazines have to live up to this?
  * Have categories, with different levels of expense & security
8. This might be a throwback to the world of “gatekeepers”
  * Maybe we have even stronger gatekeepers now (platforms); with standards it would be an open process/multistakeholder
9. This might exclude legit publishers
10. Every approved source looks the same, making it hard for humans to distinguish
