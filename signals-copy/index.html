<div><a class="edit" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16xLtANKeVp6FVi_zU8JaCLiHImR_kq1K2B2ebwMP2k0/edit#heading=h.4u9corwqzqo3">🖉</a></div>
        <p>This document is intended to support an ecosystem of interoperable credibility tools. &#xA0;These software tools, which may be components of familiar existing systems, will gather, process, and use relevant data to help people more accurately decide what information they can trust online and protect themselves from being misled. We expect that an open data-sharing architecture will facilitate efficient research and development, as well as an overall system which is more visibly trustworthy.</p>
        <p>The document has three primary audiences:</p>
        <ol start="1"><li>Software developers and computer science researchers wanting to build systems which work with credibility data. &#xA0;For them, the document aims to be a precise technical specification, stating&#xA0;what&#xA0;they need for their software to interoperate with any other software which conforms to this specification. </li><li>People who work in journalism and want to review and contribute to this technology sphere, to help make sure it is beneficial and practical.</li><li>Non-computer-science researchers, interested in helping develop and improve the science behind this work.</li></ol>
        <p>In general, we intend for this document to be:</p>
        <ul><li>Welcoming for implementers of systems using credibility data</li><li>Easy for non-tech folks to understand the proposed signals &amp; contribute</li><li>Practical to maintain by the editors</li><li>Practical to contribute to, for a wide audience</li><li>A source of accurate guidance about signal quality and adoption</li></ul>

<div><a class="edit" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16xLtANKeVp6FVi_zU8JaCLiHImR_kq1K2B2ebwMP2k0/edit#heading=h.94xsck7qz3ho">🖉</a></div>
        <p>The document builds on concepts and terminology explained in <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://credweb.org/report/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1542573925170000">Technological Approaches to Improving Credibility Assessment on the Web</a>. &#xA0;Our basic model is that an entity (human and/or machine) is attempting to make a credibility assessment &#x2014; to predict whether something will mislead them or others &#x2014; by carefully examining many different observable features of that thing and things connected with it, as well as information provided by various related or trusted sources. </p>
        <p>To simplify and unify this complex situation, with its many different roles, we model the situation as a set of observers, each using imperfect instruments to learn about the situation and then recording their observations using simple declarative statements agreed upon in advance. Because those statements are inputs to a credibility assessment process, we call them <b>credibility signals.</b>&#xA0; (The term <b>credibility indicators</b>&#xA0;is sometimes also used.)</p>
        <p>This document, then, is a guide to these signals. &#xA0;It states what each observer might say and exactly how to say it, along with other relevant information to help people choose among the possible signals and understand what it means when they are used.</p>
        <p>Because this is a new and constantly-changing field, we do not simply state which signals should be used. &#xA0;Instead, we list possible signals that one might reasonably consider using, along with information we expect to be helpful in making the decision.</p>

        <p>When building systems which use credibility signals and trying to decide which signals to use, there are different factors to weigh. &#xA0;This section is aspirational; we hope this document will in time provide guidance on all these factors. &#xA0; </p>

            <p>There are factors about how difficult it is to get an accurate value<sup><a href="#cmnt1" id="cmnt_ref1">[a]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt2" id="cmnt_ref2">[b]</a></sup>&#xA0;for the signal<sup><a href="#cmnt3" id="cmnt_ref3">[c]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt4" id="cmnt_ref4">[d]</a></sup>:</p>
            <ol start="1"><li>Do people independently observing it get approximately the same value? &#xA0;</li><li>Do observations vary with the culture, location, language, age, beliefs, etc, of the people doing the observation?</li><li>Would the same people make the same observation in future months or years?</li><li>How much time and effort does it take people to make the observation?</li><li>Do people need to be trained to make this specific observation?</li><li>What kind of general training do people need (eg a journalism degree) to do it?</li><li>How do machines compare to humans in making this observation, in terms of cost, quality, types of errors, and susceptibility to being tricked.</li></ol>
            <p>Many of these factors can be measured using inter-rater reliability (IRR) techniques. &#xA0;When studies have made such measurements, our intent is to include that data in this document.</p>
            <p>Here is a table of the data we have. &#xA0;Excerpts are listed with the relevant signals.</p>

            <p>One should also consider how the overall ecosystem of content producers and consumers might be changed by credibility tools adopting the signal.

        <p>Section 1 (&#x201C;Introduction&#x201D;) provides instructions for how to use and help maintain this document, along with general background information. </p>
        <p>The rest of this document, after the introduction, is a list of signals and information about them, as discussed in the introduction. &#xA0;The signals are organized into related groups, in hierarchical sections. &#xA0;At the lower levels of the hierarchy are the signals themselves, while the higher levels provide grouping of the signals, to help people understand them.</p>
        <p>One important level of the hierarchy identifies the <b>subject type</b>&#xA0;of the signal. &#xA0;This is the conceptual entity being examined, considered, or inspected, when one makes the observation being recorded in the signal data. &#xA0;This could be imagined in different ways: when you are observing a claim made in the 3rd paragraph of an article published in some newspaper, are you observing the claim, the paragraph, the article, the newspaper, or even the author of the article? &#xA0;In general, we aim for the smallest <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://credweb.org/report/20181011%23h.ij0k32jlsndm&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1542573925184000">granularity</a>&#xA0;that makes sense, which in this case would probably be the claim.</p>
        <p>At times, it may not be obvious to which subject type a signal belongs, or it could sensibly belong with several different ones. &#xA0;In this case, it might be moved to a different section in the document as people come to understand it better. &#xA0;When it&#x2019;s not clear, there should be links from the places a signal could reasonably be to the place it actually is.</p>
        <p>This may require discussion, and might remain open for debate. &#xA0;When a signal or group of signals makes sense in two places, consider linking it from the places it isn&#x2019;t, to help people find it.</p>
        <p>In many cases, a signal could be seen as a set of similar signals which are not strictly identical. This can be handled by adding additional signal headings with the finer distinction, when necessary. In this case, template statements might appear under more than one signal. </p>
        <p>Note that sections may be moved and renumbered. &#xA0;Do not rely on section numbers remaining the same. &#xA0;For linking to a part of the document, consider using the gdocs h.xxxxxx fragment ids, provided by the Table of Contents; those should remain stable. &#xA0;Also, whenever changing a heading, especially a signal heading, if someone might be referring to it by name, please move the old text into a paragraph starting &#x201C;Also called:&#x201D;. &#xA0;</p>

        <h2 id="h.gspkln3r92qo">Template Statements</h2>
<div><a class="edit" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16xLtANKeVp6FVi_zU8JaCLiHImR_kq1K2B2ebwMP2k0/edit#heading=h.gspkln3r92qo">🖉</a></div>
        <p>The most important thing about a signal definition is to be clear what observation the signal data is recording. If the signal heading is &#x201C;Article length&#x201D;, does that mean length in words or bytes or characters or some other metric? Does it include the title? For each signal, we want an easy way to communicate its definition that is short but clear, while being as detailed as necessary. </p>
        <p>The technique we use here is to express the semantics of the signal using plain and simple sentences in natural language which convey the same knowledge as the signal data. If you imagine people using credibility software exchanging these statements (perhaps in text messages or on Twitter), you should get the right semantics. You can assume metadata, like who sent it and when it was sent is available, so the statements can include terms like &#x201C;I&#x201D; and &#x201C;now&#x201D;.</p>
        <p>For machine-to-machine data Interoperability, these template sentences and the signal heading are turned into a data schema, after which the JSON-LD/schema.org/sematic web/linked data technology stack can be used.</p>
        <p>The statements we use are <b>templates</b>&#xA0;because they abstract over a variety of similar sentences which differ in specific limited ways. &#xA0;For example, these statements:</p>
        <p></p>
        <ol start="1"><li>I have examined the article at https://example.com/alice and find it highly credible</li><li>I have examined the article at https://example.com/brian and find it highly credible</li><li>I have examined the article at https://example.com/casey and find it highly credible</li></ol>
        <p>are all the same, except in the URL. &#xA0; We convey this using a template statement, which has a <b>variable</b>&#xA0;portion in square brackets, like:</p>
        <ul><li>I have examined the article at [subject] and find it highly credible</li></ul>
        <p></p>
        <a id="t.fff74a8c69832a720ceb13e09c6d162bc3052f2c"></a>
        <a id="t.1"></a>
        <table><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Tech note</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>If we (automatically or manually) map this template to a property with the pname :iHaveExaminedHighlyCredible, then the sentence number 2 above would be encoded in turtle as </p><ul><li>{ &lt;https://example.com/brian&gt; :iHaveExaminedHighlyCredible true }.</li></ul><p>Alternatively, we could make it a class, but boolean valued properties may be better, so that all signals remain as properties.. </p></td></tr></tbody></table>
        <p></p>
        <p>The bracketed template expression &#x201C;[subject]&#x201D; is required in every template, to indicate what entity is being observed. &#xA0;Additional bracket expressions can be used when there are other elements of the statement to make variable. &#xA0;In particular, [string] (for text in quotes) and [number].</p>
        <p>(For now, try to just use those three. &#xA0;Software and documentation is being developed to allow more features. If you find this too restrictive, go ahead and write something else inside the square brackets and we&apos;ll deal with it later, but include a question mark so it&apos;s clear you knew you were making it up.)</p>
        <p>An example needing multiple variables:</p>
        <ol start="1"><li>https://example.com/alice took 4.75 seconds to load, just now.</li><li>https://example.com/brian took 5.9 seconds to load, just now.</li></ol>
        <p>could be matched by:</p>
        <ul><li>[subject] took [number] seconds to load, just now.</li></ul>

            <p>Each section should begin with a short introduction written with a neutral point of view, reflecting consensus about why the signal might be useful and what the risks might be. To enable consensus among a broad community, the intent is for this text to be developed iteratively, with each contributor adding their perspective while respecting what is already present.</p>
            <p>Questions and minor concerns should generally be added as annotations using the &#x201C;Add a Comment&#x201D; function, without editing the document. If they become issues requiring back-and-forth discussion, they should be turned into github issues and linked from the most relevant place in this document with a paragraph starting &#x201C;Issue:&#x201D;</p>
            <p>These discussion sections are intended to be nonnormative. That is, they do not say how software using the signal is required to behave for interoperability. The normative content of this specification is the template statements and the mapping of the statements to RDF.</p>

            <p>If you are confident you understand what a signal is intended to measure, and think you can provide a template statement which expresses it more clearly and simply, with little ambiguity, please add a new row to the bottom of the &#x201C;Proposed template statements&#x201D; table and add your entry. &#xA0;Please also put the next higher number in the <b>Key</b>&#xA0;field for reference, and your name in the <b>By</b>&#xA0;field. This &#x201C;by&#x201D; field is optional; it is intended to help simplify discussion, telling people who to talk to, and to give some credit. Listing the name of a large group in this field is not particularly useful. &#xA0;</p>
            <p>After adding an entry, for a short time (perhaps a few hours, guided by any comments on it) it&#x2019;s okay to edit it if you change your mind. After that, please leave it, and just add a new row for the new version. You can put new versions in the middle of the table and use keys like 1a.</p>

    <p>This section is for signals about claims.</p>
    <p>A claim is &#x201C;an assertion that is open to disagreement; equivalently, a meaningful declarative sentence which is logically either true or false (to some degree); equivalently, a proposition in<a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_calculus&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1542573925200000">&#xA0;</a><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_calculus&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1542573925200000">propositional logic</a>.&#x201D; [<a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://credweb.org/report/20181011%23h.k3a5bxg8k9ru&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1542573925201000">credweb report</a>]</p>
    <p>Claims can be stated (with various decree of clarity) in some content or implied by the content (even non-textual content, like a photograph).</p>
    <p>Claims are usually the smallest practical granularity. Credibility data about claims is largely focussed on what other sources have said about that claim, as in fact checking, but could also involve relationships between claims and textual analysis of claim text. </p>
    <section>
        <h2 id="h.nf6ves3oihme">Claim Review</h2>
<div><a class="edit" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16xLtANKeVp6FVi_zU8JaCLiHImR_kq1K2B2ebwMP2k0/edit#heading=h.nf6ves3oihme">🖉</a></div>
        <p>The &#x201C;ClaimReview&#x201D; model developed at schema.org grows out of the tradition of independent, external fact-checking, as in <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.politifact.com/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1542573925202000">PolitiFact</a>. &#xA0;With this model, a fact-checker reviews a claim, typically made by a public figure, and then publishes a review of that claim, a &#x201C;claim review&#x201D;. Within schema.org, this parallels other reviews, like restaurant reviews.</p>
        <p>[ Can we fit claimreview neatly into this observer/signal model? &#xA0;It&#x2019;s a bit of a stretch. &#xA0;TBD. ]</p>

    <p>Includes: phrase, sentence, paragraph, document, document fragment</p>
    <p>A text, in this sense, is a sequence of words, with the usual punctuation, and sometimes embedded multimedia content or meaningful layout, like tables. &#xA0;That is, it&#x2019;s a document or portion of a document. As examples, a phrase, sentence, paragraph, document section, book chapter, book, and complete book series would typically each count as a text. &#xA0;</p>
    <p>Signals here concern properties of the text, itself, separate from how it might be published (eg on a <a href="#h.lub1njgvolel">Web Page</a>, on a billboard, spoken at a rally) or where it might be published (in some <a href="#h.3d3rw8hardr8">Venue)</a>. &#xA0;The text should be considered immutable: a text (in this sense) doesn&apos;t change. &#xA0;If you take a text and change it, you are making a new text, which needs to be reexamined, to see which observations (and thus which signal data) applies to this other, new text.</p>
    <p>Issue: (tech) How to represent texts in RDF? &#xA0;Options include annotation URL with secure hash, annotation object URL with secure hash, data: URI, etc.</p>

        <h2 id="h.vfqf1716ordj">Formality</h2>

        <p>Texts adopt a tone to appeal to their audience and/or attempt to convey how the text should be used. For instance, an academic study is written in formal, verbose and grammatically correct language, while a listicle is short, informal and often humorous. The academic study uses these characteristics to convey authority, while the listicle is intentionally unauthoritative. &#xA0;</p>
